# 🧹 Legacy Soldier/GPU Cleanup - Ready to Execute

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Project:** Empire (Supabase: miflbztkdctpibawermj)  
**Migration:** 002_cleanup_legacy_soldiersgpu.sql  
**Status:** 📦 **Ready for Execution**

---

## 🎯 What This Migration Does

This migration completes the Cars theme cutover by **permanently removing all Soldier/GPU era artifacts** from your Supabase database.

### Before Migration:
- Database contains legacy soldier/gpu units, tiers, and pack odds
- Mixed content (cars + soldiers + gpus) in various tables
- Legacy table schemas (soldier_tiers, gpu_tiers, data_center_levels, etc.)
- Old reason strings in economy_ledger (open-crate, upgrade-base, etc.)

### After Migration:
- ✅ **Cars-only content** in all tables
- ✅ **Zero legacy units** (no soldiers/gpus in player_units)
- ✅ **Clean pack odds** (only 7 Cars tiers: beater → godspeed)
- ✅ **Normalized schemas** (garage_level replaces data_center_level)
- ✅ **Updated ledger** (modern reason strings: open-pack, train, recycle)
- ✅ **Safe archives** (all legacy data preserved in _archive schema)

---

## 📦 Files Created

### 1. Migration SQL
**Location:** `empire-forge-auth/migrations/002_cleanup_legacy_soldiersgpu.sql`

**What it does:**
- Creates `_archive` schema for safety
- Snapshots all legacy tables and rows
- Deletes soldier/gpu units from `player_units`
- Cleans up `pack_odds` (removes non-Cars entries)
- Normalizes `economy_ledger` reason strings
- Updates `profiles` schema (garage_level, removes data_center_level)
- Renames legacy tables to `*_old` (not dropped!)
- Re-seeds Cars-only pack odds
- Adds necessary indexes

**Safety Features:**
- ✅ Idempotent (safe to re-run)
- ✅ Atomic transaction (auto-rollback on error)
- ✅ Full archival before deletion
- ✅ Tables renamed, not dropped

---

### 2. Healthcheck Queries
**Location:** `empire-forge-auth/migrations/HEALTHCHECKS.sql`

**Purpose:** Quick verification queries to run after migration.

**Includes:**
- Check for remaining legacy units (should be 0)
- Verify pack odds are Cars-only (should be exactly 7 rows)
- Sample recent units (should all be Cars)
- Confirm archive tables exist
- Verify profiles schema update
- Check economy_ledger normalization

**Usage:**
```bash
# After running migration, copy/paste queries from HEALTHCHECKS.sql
# into Supabase SQL Editor to verify success
```

---

## 🚀 How to Execute Migration

### Step 1: Review Migration File (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Read the migration SQL
cat empire-forge-auth/migrations/002_cleanup_legacy_soldiersgpu.sql
```

**What you'll see:**
- Clear comments explaining each step
- Safe snapshot operations
- Targeted deletions (only legacy data)
- Table renames (not drops)
- Pack odds re-seeding for Cars

---

### Step 2: Run Migration in Supabase

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/miflbztkdctpibawermj/sql
   - Or: Project Dashboard → SQL Editor

2. **Execute Migration**
   ```sql
   -- Copy entire contents of 002_cleanup_legacy_soldiersgpu.sql
   -- Paste into SQL Editor
   -- Click "Run" or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter
   ```

3. **Monitor Execution**
   - Watch for completion message
   - Check for any error messages
   - Migration runs in single transaction (auto-rollback on error)

**Expected Duration:** 10-30 seconds (depends on data volume)

---

### Step 3: Run Healthchecks

After migration completes, verify success:

1. **Open HEALTHCHECKS.sql**
   ```bash
   cat empire-forge-auth/migrations/HEALTHCHECKS.sql
   ```

2. **Run Each Query in Supabase SQL Editor**
   - Copy/paste queries one by one
   - Compare results with expected values (see comments in file)

3. **Quick Pass/Fail Check**
   ```sql
   -- This should return: soldier_like = 0, gpu_like = 0
   SELECT
     (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM player_units WHERE name ~* '(infantry|cavalry|archer|tank|sniper)') AS soldier_like,
     (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM player_units WHERE name ~* '(rtx|gtx|bitmain|antminer|miner|asic|s19|4090|3060|1050)') AS gpu_like;
   
   -- This should return exactly 7 rows (Cars tiers only)
   SELECT pack_type, tier_key::text, odds_pct
   FROM pack_odds
   ORDER BY odds_pct DESC;
   ```

---

### Step 4: Verify Edge Functions

All edge functions are already Cars-themed (verified in code review):

✅ **No changes needed** - All functions use Cars data structures:
- `open-pack` - Grants cars with tier_key
- `train-unit` - Upgrades level only (1→3)
- `recycle-unit` - Tier promotion (20% chance)
- `claim-rewards` - MP from car stats

❌ **Check for legacy functions to delete:**
- `open-crate`
- `train-soldier`
- `recycle-soldier`
- `upgrade-data-center`
- Any mining/GPU functions

**How to check:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/miflbztkdctpibawermj/functions
2. Look for any legacy function names
3. Delete them if they exist

---

### Step 5: Test Frontend (Optional)

If you have a frontend connected:

1. **Open Garage** - Should show only cars (no soldiers/GPUs)
2. **Open a Pack** - Should grant only cars
3. **Train a Unit** - Should upgrade level only
4. **Recycle a Unit** - Should promote or burn (20%/80%)
5. **Check Stats** - Should show car-based calculations

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

Migration is successful when ALL of these pass:

### Database State:
- [ ] `soldier_like = 0` (no soldier units)
- [ ] `gpu_like = 0` (no GPU units)
- [ ] Exactly 7 `pack_odds` rows (Cars tiers only)
- [ ] All `player_units` have valid Cars `tier_key`
- [ ] `profiles.garage_level` exists, `data_center_level` removed
- [ ] No legacy `reason` strings in `economy_ledger`

### Archive State:
- [ ] `_archive` schema exists
- [ ] Legacy data safely snapshotted
- [ ] Legacy tables renamed to `*_old`

### Functions & Frontend:
- [ ] All Cars-themed edge functions work
- [ ] No legacy function names remain
- [ ] Frontend shows only Cars content

---

## 🔄 Rollback (If Needed)

If something goes wrong, you can rollback:

### Option 1: Restore Specific Data
```sql
-- Restore legacy units from archive
INSERT INTO player_units 
SELECT * FROM _archive.player_units_legacy_rows
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Restore old pack odds
DELETE FROM pack_odds;
INSERT INTO pack_odds SELECT * FROM _archive.pack_odds_snapshot;
```

### Option 2: Restore Tables
```sql
-- Rename *_old tables back
ALTER TABLE soldier_tiers_old RENAME TO soldier_tiers;
ALTER TABLE gpu_tiers_old RENAME TO gpu_tiers;
-- etc.
```

**Note:** See `POST_MIGRATION_VERIFICATION.md` for detailed rollback procedures.

## 📊 Edge Functions Status

### ✅ Cars-Themed (Already Updated)
All these functions are fully Cars-themed and require no changes:

| Function | Status | Cars Integration |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| `open-pack` | ✅ Active | Grants cars with tier_key, level=1, car stats |
| `train-unit` | ✅ Active | Level-only progression (1→3), cost = 10 × targetLevel |
| `recycle-unit` | ✅ Active | 20% promote to next tier, 80% burn unit |
| `claim-rewards` | ✅ Active | MP calculated from car stats (hp × [1 + grip%]) |
| `list-units` | ✅ Active | Lists player's cars with stats |
| `economy-stats` | ✅ Active | Recognizes new ledger kinds (train_level_up, recycle_promote, recycle_burn) |

**Code Review Summary:**
- No soldier/gpu references found in any active edge function
- All functions use Cars data structures (tier_key, level, hp_base, grip_pct, fuel)
- Helper functions in `_shared/cars.ts` provide Cars-specific logic
- Backward compatibility mapping exists for old unit_type → tier_key
