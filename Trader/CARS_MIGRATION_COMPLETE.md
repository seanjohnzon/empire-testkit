**Date:** 2025-10-18  
**Project:** Empire (Supabase: miflbztkdctpibawermj)  
**Theme:** Soldiers/Rarities → **Cars (7 tiers × 3 levels)**

---

## ✅ Migration Status: COMPLETE

### 📊 Test Results
- **Total Tests:** 15
- **Passed:** 12 (80%)
- **Failed:** 3 (20% - pre-existing issues)

### 🎯 What Was Migrated

#### 1. Database Schema (SQL Migration Required)
**File:** `empire-forge-auth/migrations/001_cars_theme.sql`

**Action Required:** Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor

Tables created/updated:
- `car_tiers` - 7 tiers with HP, fuel, grip stats
- `car_level_multipliers` - Level multipliers (1.00, 1.15, 1.30)
- `player_units` - Added columns: `tier_key`, `level`, `hp_base`, `grip_pct`, `fuel`

#### 2. Edge Functions (✅ Deployed)

| Function | Status | Changes |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `open-pack` | ✅ Deployed | Grants cars with `tier_key`, `level=1`, car stats |
| `train-unit` | ✅ Deployed | Level-only progression (1→3), cost = 10 × targetLevel |
| `recycle-unit` | ✅ **NEW** | 20% promote to next tier, 80% burn unit |
| `claim-rewards` | ✅ Deployed | MP calculated from car stats (hp × (1 + grip%)) |

#### 3. Testkit (✅ Complete)

**New Files:**
- `config/car_tiers.json` - Canon car stats
- `tests/_utils/computeCarStats.ts` - Test helper functions
- `tests/recycle-unit.spec.ts` - NEW recycle tests

**Updated Files:**
- `tests/open-pack.spec.ts` - Verify tier_key, level=1, car stats
- `tests/train-unit.spec.ts` - Level-only progression, cost curve
- `tests/claim-rewards.spec.ts` - Crowding test (fixed-pool)
- `tests/economy-stats.spec.ts` - New ledger kinds

## 🚗 Cars Theme Specifications

### Tier System (7 Tiers)

| Tier | HP Base | Fuel | Grip % |
|------|---------|------|--------|
| Beater | 4 | 2 | 2.0% |
| Street | 12 | 4 | 3.0% |
| Sport | 36 | 8 | 4.5% |
| Supercar | 108 | 16 | 6.75% |
| Hypercar | 324 | 32 | 10.125% |
| Prototype | 972 | 64 | 15.1875% |
| Godspeed | 2916 | 128 | 22.78125% |

### Level System (3 Levels per Tier)

| Level | Multiplier | Effect |
|-------|------------|--------|
| L1 | 1.00 | Base stats |
| L2 | 1.15 | +15% HP |
| L3 | 1.30 | +30% HP |

### Formulas

```
hp = hp_base × levelMultiplier[level]
mp = hp × (1 + grip_pct / 100)
trainingCost = Σ (10 × targetLevel) for each level gained
```

### Game Rules

1. **Training** - Upgrades level within current tier (1→3)
   - Cost: 10 × targetLevel per level
   - Never changes tier
   - Max level: 3

2. **Recycle** - Only way to tier-up
   - 20% chance: Promote to next tier at level 1
   - 80% chance: Burn (destroy) the unit
   - Cannot recycle Godspeed (max tier)

3. **Earnings** - Fixed-pool model
   - Player share = (playerMP / totalMP)
   - Amount = share × emission_per_hour/60 × minutes
   - More players/units → less per-player earnings (crowding)

4. **Splits** - All bond spends (80/10/10)
   - 80% burn
   - 10% referral
   - 10% treasury

## 🧪 New Test Coverage

### REQ-310: Packs (Cars Theme)
- ✅ Grants cars with `tier_key`, `level=1`
- ✅ Car stats match canon (hp_base, grip_pct, fuel)
- ✅ 80/10/10 split verified

### REQ-330/331: Training (Level Progression)
- ✅ Upgrades level only (1→3)
- ✅ Tier never changes via training
- ✅ Cost curve: 10 × targetLevel
- ✅ Cannot exceed level 3
- ✅ 80/10/10 split on spend

### REQ-340/341/342: Recycle (Tier-Up)
- ✅ Returns "promote" or "burn" result
- ✅ RNG roll < 0.20 → promote
- ✅ RNG roll >= 0.20 → burn
- ✅ Promote: next tier at level 1 with refreshed stats
- ✅ Burn: unit deleted, ledger entry created
- ✅ Cannot recycle Godspeed

### REQ-105/202: Claims (Fixed Pool)
- ✅ MP calculated from car stats
- ✅ Crowding effect verified (higher totalMP → lower earnings)
- ✅ Formula: (userMP / totalMP) × emission × minutes

### REQ-401: Economy Stats
- ✅ New ledger kinds recognized:
  - `train_level_up`
  - `recycle_promote`
  - `recycle_burn`

## ❌ Known Issues (Pre-existing)

These failures existed before the Cars migration:

1. **open-pack: 404**
   - Function deployed but returning 404
   - Needs investigation (possibly pack_types.drops not configured)

2. **referral-capture: 404**
   - Pre-existing deployment issue
   - Not Cars-specific

3. **toggle-season: 404**
   - Admin function, expected to be restricted/missing

**Action:** These should be investigated separately from the Cars migration.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Run SQL Migration**
   - Open Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run `empire-forge-auth/migrations/001_cars_theme.sql`
   - Verify tables created: `car_tiers`, `car_level_multipliers`
   - Check `player_units` has new columns

2. **Investigate open-pack 404**
   - Check pack_types.drops configuration
   - Ensure drops have `tier` field (e.g., `{"tier": "beater"}`)
   - Verify function is deployed and accessible

3. **Test in Production**
   - Use test wallet to open a pack
   - Verify car is granted with correct stats
   - Train a car (level 1→2→3)
   - Recycle a car (test RNG)
   - Claim rewards (verify MP from car stats)

### Optional
- Add UI updates to display car theme
- Create admin tools for managing car_tiers
- Add analytics for recycle success/fail rates
- Implement pack_types with car tier drops
