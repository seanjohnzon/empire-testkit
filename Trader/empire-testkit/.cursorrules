# Cursor guardrails
- Do NOT modify these files unless this prompt explicitly says so:
  - .env.example
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml
  - .github/workflows/pages.yml
  - package.json
  - scripts/snapshot.mjs
  - tests/reqmap.ts
- If a protected file must change, propose an explicit unified diff and wait for approval.

# Diffs & style
- Show surgical diffs file-by-file; avoid unrelated formatting.
- Ask to APPLY after showing changes.

# Testing
- Use existing npm scripts: "test", "ci:html", "snapshot".
- When logic changes in app functions, add minimal coverage or curl examples.
